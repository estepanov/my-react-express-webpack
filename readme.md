# Welcome

This is my attempt to create a boilerplate utilizing the latest versions of:

- React
- Redux
- React router
- Webpack
- Node
- Express
- Sequelize
- PostgreSQL

**This project is in no way complete yet. Do not use it, yet!**

The goal is to also include documentation following every step of the process so that anyone could replicate the steps if they wanted to, as well as being a great personal refrence.

Instructions will be placed inside of the [documentation folder](documentation/readme.md). For example you can find the instructutions on recreating this entire project in [starting_from_scratch.md](documentation/starting_from_scratch.md).
